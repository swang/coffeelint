            This rule imposes a standard number of spaces to be used for
            indentation. Since whitespace is significant in CoffeeScript, it's
            critical that a project chooses a standard indentation format and
            stays consistent. Other roads lead to darkness. <pre> <code>#
            Enabling this option will prevent this ugly
